Quick Start Guide for Metadata Extractor v1.0.0

1. Ensure that the IMAGES_IN directory is properly set up in the same directory as the executable and contains JPEG images.
2. Run the MetadataExtractor executable.
3. The program will check the IMAGES_OUT and IMAGES_ERROR directories and prompt to clear them if they are not empty.
4. If the directories are cleared or already empty, the program will proceed to process the images.
5. Results (extracted metadata and any errors) will be logged and saved in the IMAGES_OUT and IMAGES_ERROR directories respectively.
6. Review the metadata_extraction.log file for detailed logs of the operation.

Note: Ensure that no other process is using the directories while the Metadata Extractor is running.
